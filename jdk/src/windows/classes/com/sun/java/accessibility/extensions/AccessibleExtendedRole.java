/**
 * <P>Class AccessibleExtendedRole contains extensions to the class
 * AccessibleRole that are currently not in a public API.
 *
 * <P>Class AccessibleRole determines the role of a component.  The role
 * of a component describes its generic function. (E.G.,
 * "push button," "table," or "list.")
 * <p>The constants in this class present a strongly typed enumeration
 * of common object roles.  A public constructor for this class has been
 * purposely omitted and applications should use one of the constants
 * from this class.  If the constants in this class are not sufficient
 * to describe the role of an object, a subclass should be generated
 * from this class and it should provide constants in a similar manner.
